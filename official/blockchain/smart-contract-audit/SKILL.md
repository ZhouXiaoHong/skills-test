# Smart Contract Audit

Use this skill when reviewing Solidity contracts for security issues.

## Steps

1. Review access control and ownership checks.
2. Check reentrancy, integer overflow, and unsafe external calls.
3. Confirm event emissions and error handling.

See `checklist.md` and `templates/audit-report.md` for guidance.
